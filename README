====================
CVE Email alert tool
====================

This tool monitors cvedetails.com for vulnerabilties for a given software package.
It is designed to run periodically, such as from a cron script.

It is pre-configured to send notifications via a sendgrid mail daemon.

------------
Installation
------------

To install, you'll first need to have a working Python environment.
Most OS X and Linux distributions should ship with this out of the box.

For ease of installation, this tool uses Python 2.7 rather than 3.x,
since that ships pre-installed with most machines.
You'll want to ensure that you have a virtual environment setup to
isolate the library dependencies.

We'll ensure the virtualenv tool, then create an isolated env for this app.
    pip install virtualenv --user
    virtualenv notifier
    . notifier/bin/activate

Once we have the virtualenv setup, we can install the required libraries.
    pip install -r requirements.txt

-----
Usage
-----
Running the tool is very straightfoward.
Once your python env is setup and your dependencies are installed, run
    ./cve_notify.py
This will connect to cvedetails.com and retrieve a list of vulnerabilities.
These details are saved in datafile.


--------------------------
Adding Products to monitor
--------------------------
Currently, this tool is monitoring OpenSSL and OpenSSH.
It's straightforward to add additional tools.

Generate a JSON api call using their vendor ID - You can do this from the
"Vulnerability Feeds & Widgets" section, under the vendor's page, such as
https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/217/Openssl.html


------------
Enhancements
------------
There are several ways this tool could be enhanced, if more time were allocated.

It would be straightfoward to add a config file (and/or command line arguments)
to store the SMTP server and email information, rather than hardcoding.

The alert email could be cleaned up to include better formatting, such as a
comma-separated list of CVEs, the HTML could be broken to a template and improved, etc.

Additionally, better error handling could be added - This alert handles the happy-path
where the servers reply properly, but does not handle SMTP errors, etc.
